Hashcode 2017 - Google algorithm competition

## What is hashcode ?
The hashcode is a team up to solve a real-life engineering problem from Google. I decided to take part to this event with [@Nilct](https://github.com/nilct) because we love challenges and problem-solving.

## Results
We were getting the first place at the hub from ENPC - Ponts & Chauss√©es Paritech, with 2 040 526 points. That means we are ranking #584 on more than 2800 teams around the world. We are ranking 78th in France. Congrats !
